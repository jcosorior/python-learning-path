#Compount interest ecuation
#A = P(1+(r/n))áµ— 
#A = final amount
#P = initial principal balance
#r = interest rate
#t = number of time periods elapsed
#n = number of times interest is capitilized in one year

#this is my attemp before the tutorial way, (I gave myself two hours to resolve it)
#the excerscise doesn't disclose the value for n, I gave it 12 
#rate = 1.3
#time = 1
#n = 12
#principle = float(input("What is your principle balance? "))

#    print(f"Your debt is ${a:.2f}")
#    break
#else:

#I took 1.8 hours :D #I realize if the user types a negative number, my program doesn`t have something for that

#now I will type what it says the tutorial

#principle = 0

# Conclusions
#I need to validate user inputs
# Ensure the ecuation uses the rate in decimal form (divede rate by 100 if it's in percentage)
# Avoid infinite loops by updating values inside the while loop
# format the output for better clarity
